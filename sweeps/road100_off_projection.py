"""Exact ROAD100 opt-in source hunks projected away for frozen legacy audits.

The fixture was built from the original working tree versus the strictly
default-OFF ROAD100 experiments. Each replacement requires an exact, unique
current hunk; partial or silently modified experiments fail closed. Historical
SHA fixtures remain untouched. This is a source-level projection, not a claim
about runtime equivalence (verified by real paired smoke benches separately).

To recreate a fixture during initial review only:
